// The gate registry's own cases, run from the test suite.
//
// `tools/git-hooks/gate_registry.py --self-test` holds the properties that
// keep the gate set honest: an unclassified path forces the full run, an
// always-on gate classifies nothing, every registered gate has a script and
// every script is registered, and the derived run order puts dependencies
// first and cheap gates ahead of expensive ones.
//
// The runner already refuses to start when those cases fail, but that only
// covers a developer who runs a gate. Nothing in CI executed them, so a
// registry edit that broke the selection could reach main and only show up
// as gates quietly not running — the same class of silence the registry
// exists to prevent. This test is the CI-side witness.
//
// It reads the whole `scripts/gates/` directory and every workflow, so it is
// registered in `workflow_trigger_coverage`'s tree-wide gate list and runs
// from an unfiltered workflow.
