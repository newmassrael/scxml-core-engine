 * @brief W3C SCXML 3.7.1: Top-level final state halts execution
 *
 * This manual test verifies that entering a top-level final state
 * immediately halts the state machine before processing any raised events.
 *
 * Test structure:
 * - Initial state: final (top-level final state)
 * - Entry action: raise "event1"
 * - Expected: State machine halts at Final, event1 is NOT processed
 *
 * W3C SCXML 3.7.1: "When a state machine enters a top-level final state,
 * it must halt execution and may not process any further events."
