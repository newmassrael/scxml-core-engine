 * @brief W3C SCXML 3.3.2: done.state.id event generation for compound states
 *
 * Tests that when a compound state's final child state is entered,
 * the platform automatically generates a done.state.id event.
 *
 * Test structure:
 * - State s1 (compound) has child state s11 (compound)
 * - State s11 has final state s11final
 * - When s11final is entered, done.state.s11 event is generated
 * - Transition on done.state.s11 moves to pass state
 *
 * W3C SCXML 3.3.2: "When the state machine enters the final child of a
 * compound state, the platform must generate a done.state.id event where
 * id is the id of the compound state."
