 * @brief W3C SCXML 5.10: _event variable binding and persistence
 *
 * Tests that the SCXML Processor binds the _event variable when an event
 * is pulled off the internal or external event queue to be processed, and
 * keeps the variable bound to that event until another event is processed.
 *
 * The test verifies that _event.name remains "foo" during the onentry of
 * the next state (s1), even after a new event "bar" is raised.
