 * @brief W3C SCXML 3.11: History states work correctly (deep/shallow)
 *
 * Tests that history states work correctly. The counter Var1 counts how many times
 * we have entered s0. The initial state is s012. We then transition to s1, which
 * transitions to s0's deep history state. entering.s012 should be raised. Then we
 * transition to s02, which transitions to s0's shallow history state. That should
 * have value s01, and its initial state s011 should be entered.
