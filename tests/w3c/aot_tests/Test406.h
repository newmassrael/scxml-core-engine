 * @brief W3C SCXML 3.3: State entry order with parallel regions
 *
 * Tests that states are entered in proper entry order (parents before children
 * with document order used to break ties) after executable content in transitions
 * is executed. Validates that when entering a parallel state with child regions,
 * the parent's onentry executes before children's onentry, ensuring event order:
 * event1 (transition) → event2 (parallel onentry) → event3 (region1 onentry) → event4 (region2 onentry).
