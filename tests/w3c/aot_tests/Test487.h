/**
 * @brief W3C SCXML 5.3/5.4: Illegal assignment error.execution event
 *
 * Tests that attempting to access a property on undefined raises error.execution event.
 * The test initializes with an assignment expression that tries to access
 * undefined.invalidProperty, which should trigger error.execution.
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * - Assignment expression: Var1 = undefined.invalidProperty
 * - Runtime evaluation via JSEngine detects illegal access
 * - error.execution event raised and caught by transition
 * - Transitions to pass state upon receiving error.execution
 *
 * Uses Static Hybrid approach: static state machine structure with
 * runtime ECMAScript expression evaluation via JSEngine.
