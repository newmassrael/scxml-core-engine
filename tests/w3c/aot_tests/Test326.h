 * @brief W3C SCXML B.2.3: _ioprocessors system variable immutability
 *
 * Tests that the _ioprocessors system variable:
 * 1. Is bound at session start
 * 2. Stays bound throughout the session
 * 3. Cannot be assigned to (raises error.execution)
 * 4. Remains immutable after failed assignment attempts
 *
 * Expected behavior:
 * - s0: Check Var1 = _ioprocessors is defined → s1
 * - s1: Attempt assign to _ioprocessors → error.execution → s2
 * - s2: Verify Var2 = _ioprocessors still bound → pass
