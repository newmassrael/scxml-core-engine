# Codec API changes a downstream consumer makes

A consumer that pins SCE at a commit and regenerates its codecs reads this file when it moves the pin. Each section
is one landing, oldest first, and names:

- the commit that changed the generated or runtime API;
- what stops compiling or behaves differently in the consumer's code;
- how to write it now.

The design behind each change is in the ADR it names; this file only says what the consumer does. ADR 0078 makes
it a rule: a landing that changes what a consumer compiles against, or what a decode accepts, adds its section here
in the same commit. A consumer moving
across several landings moves its pin one section at a time, regenerating and building at each. Each step's errors
then come from one change and point at one replacement, where a single move across all of them mixes every change
into one set of errors.

Before regenerating at a new pin, check every codec document the consumer owns with
`sce-codegen --error-format=json check <document> -l <language>`, which reaches the verdict `generate` would and writes
nothing. Write the generated tree only once every document passes, so that a refused generation never leaves a tree
that is half one pin and half the other.

## A codec states whether its encode can refuse: `sce:encode-may-fail` (ADR 0065 step 1)

Landing: `b1ede72108`.

- A codec whose encode can refuse a value declares `sce:encode-may-fail="true"` on its root; the build refuses a
  missing declaration (`codec/undeclared-encode-refusal`) and an untrue one
  (`codec/encode-may-fail-without-refusal`).
- A total codec's `encode_to_vec` returns `Vec<u8>` and its `encode` only the sink's error. A `may-fail` codec's
  return `Result<_, CodecError>`.
- An implementor of `SceSink` outside the tree adds `type Error = CodecError;`.
- Each later landing that removes a kind of refusal makes some declarations untrue. After moving the pin, drop the
  declaration from each document the build names with `codec/encode-may-fail-without-refusal`, and remove the `?` or
  `.expect(..)` at that codec's `encode_to_vec` call sites. Whether a held codec can refuse is computed from its own
  document, not read from its declaration, so dropping a child's declaration never makes its parent's untrue: one
  pass over the refused documents is enough.

## The default arm's tag is a type (ADR 0065 §6 R3)

Landing: `11e90bcd77` (with `ed2f5d7453`).

- A variant's catch-all arm holds `{Codec}UnknownTag`, built with `{Codec}UnknownTag::new(tag) -> Option<Self>`; the
  `Option` is `None` for a tag a known arm names.
- To move one codec's unknown tag into another's whose arms name the same tags under the same bits, use
  `UnknownTag::from_unknown` (`use sce_forge_runtime::codec::UnknownTag;`). The inclusion is checked when the call
  compiles, so there is no `unreachable!()` for a `None`.

## A list is held within its bound as a type (ADR 0065 §6 R2)

Landing: `9584ab3731`, trees `a1046ed4da`.

- A codec no longer refuses a list on encode, and 14 SCE documents became total: see the first section for
  declarations.
- The source trait's list accessor returns `BoundedIter<I, MAX>`. A hand-written source builds it with
  `BoundedIter::new(iter)` (checked, `None` past the bound), from a held `Bounded` with `.iter()`, or keeps the count
  of one it has with `.map(..)` (`self.list.iter().map(Entry)`).
- `{Codec}Parts`, the owned form and the view hold a list as `Bounded<L, MAX>`. Build it with `Bounded::new(list)`
  (checked), `From<&[T; N]>` for an array within the bound, or `From<heapless::Vec<T, N>>` with `N <= MAX` (both
  checked when compiled). Read it through `Deref`, `.iter()`, `.len()`, `.inner()`, `.into_inner()`; an owned list
  of the storage profile reads through `.list_iter()`. A `Bounded` has no mutable access.
- The decoded eager struct keeps its `heapless::Vec<_, MAX>`.
- An owned TLV chain's capacity is its `max-depth` (it was 16).
- A type that held a list of an owned form directly (`SceList` bounds on a consumer's own wrapper) holds the
  `Bounded` instead.

## A flag input the value says is no encode argument (ADR 0065 §6 R4a)

Landing: `a17721f5cb`.

- An input that one gated field or one embedded body says is derived from the value. `encode` no longer takes an
  argument for it, and `{Codec}::input_{i}(src)` returns it; `decode` still takes it.
- A parent's carrier flag bound to such a child is derived from the child, so the parent no longer passes the bit,
  and a flag that could be overridden lost its override where it became derived.
- A Rust broadcast log of an element that says a flag input stores it as the element says it; `publish` no longer
  takes it.

## A variant's tag is read from the arm a value holds

Landings: `e5f4a7fcf8`, `90f2a4807a`.

- `{Codec}VariantSource::tag()` and `{Codec}::tag_of(src)` are new.
- A Rust broadcast log's `publish` drops its tag parameter, and its `Item` drops its `tag` field; read it with
  `Element::tag_of(&item.element)`.
- `81fbddad13` adds `reader_deferred` to the Rust log; nothing existing changes.

## The fields one gate decides are one group (ADR 0065 §6 R4b)

Landing: `7d003ca72a`, trees `5a1145e4d0`.

- Two or more presented fields gated on one one-bit flag or flag input stop being separate `Option` fields. Each
  form (source trait, parts, decoded value, view, owned) holds one field named after the gate:
  - one side: `Option<{Codec}{Gate}<..>>`, a struct of the fields present while the gate holds (or while it does
    not, for `!Gate`);
  - both sides: an enum `{Codec}{Gate}` with `{Gate}(..)` and `Not{Gate}(..)`.
- A length stated while its content is absent belongs to the side where the content is absent.
- Code that read or set the members one by one reads them through the group and builds the group whole: a codec
  whose `sn_res` and `batch_size` are gated on `S` holds `s: Option<{Codec}S>`, read as
  `v.s.map(|g| g.sn_res)`. The gate flag is derived from the group and is no longer set by hand.

## A disjunction of a codec's own flags is a group of arms (ADR 0065 §6 R4c)

Landings: `4cfff49760`, `5779e8ecc1`.

- A gate `a.X || b.Y` over one-bit flags of the codec's own carrier makes a group with one arm for each assignment
  that satisfies it, named after the flags it holds set (`WantsA`, `WantsB`, `WantsAWantsB`). The group is an enum
  `{Codec}{Carrier}{Flags}` in Pascal case word by word (`CodecPresentIfDisjunctionFlagsWantsAOrWantsB`), held as
  `Option<..>` in a field named after the carrier and its flags (`flags_wants_a_or_wants_b`), `None` where no flag
  is set. A flag written in capitals is a word (`Current`, not `CURRENT`).
- The flags are derived from the arm.

## An entry-flag chain holds at least one entry (ADR 0065 §6 R7)

Landing: `b43122a815`.

- A decode refuses, as `NeedMoreBytes`, a frame that ends before the first entry of a chain closed by an entry flag.
  A consumer that read such a frame as an empty chain receives the refusal.

## An entry-flag chain is a list of one entry or more (ADR 0065 §6 R7)

Landing: `e89183dd53`, trees `fb93729dea`.

- `Bounded` and `BoundedIter` take a third parameter, the fewest entries: `Bounded<L, MAX, MIN = 0>`. A chain closed
  by an entry flag (`terminate-on="entry-flag"`) is `Bounded<_, MAX, 1>` in every form, the decoded value included,
  which held a bare `heapless::Vec<_, MAX>` before. A value with no entry cannot be built: `Bounded::new` answers
  `None` for an empty list, and the default value holds one default entry.
- Code that pushed into a decoded value's chain fills it through `refill(|v| { .. })`, which checks the count it
  leaves against both bounds. Code that read it reads through `Deref` as before.
- An always-present chain's view holds its first entry apart from the rest (`NonEmptyListView`).

## A declared bound is part of a field's type (ADR 0077 step 1)

Landing: `3ee3508e44`, trees `dbd58e4ad8`, `15f1340899`.

- Every backend's decode refuses a `tail` or `length-ref` field longer than its bound, and a list whose count is
  past its `max-count`, before it slices or allocates: `LengthOutOfRange` for a byte or text length,
  `TooManyElements` for a count. A frame past its bound is never reported as `NeedMoreBytes`.
- C++ and Kotlin return their sentinel and record the reason on the cursor (`SceCursor::last_refusal()`,
  `SceCursor.lastRefusal`). Python's `decode` returns `None` for every refusal, on the positional path too, where an
  undeclared enum value used to raise. C11 returns `SCE_FORGE_CODEC_LENGTH_OUT_OF_RANGE` or the new
  `SCE_FORGE_CODEC_TOO_MANY_ELEMENTS`, and a C11 encode refuses a list or chain past its bound with the status its
  decode gives.
- The parser requires `sce:max-size` on every `tail` and `length-ref` field and `max-count` on every
  `<sce:repeat>` (`validation/missing-attribute`).
- No declaration changes. A test that expected an over-bound frame to decode, or to be refused as `NeedMoreBytes`,
  expects the new refusal.

## Lists refined by the kind of entry a chain's gate names (ADR 0065 §6 R6, runtime)

Landing: `c56b2aae14`.

- The runtime adds `Key`, `Except`, `Placed`, `Slot` and `Slots` (module `membership`, re-exported from `codec`).
  No generated codec uses them yet and nothing a consumer wrote changes. They are the types a codec gated on
  `chain.has(k)` will hold once R6a lands: the chain without the named entry where the gate does not hold, and the
  other entries with the named entry's place where it does.

## The refined chains take the chain's bounds (ADR 0065 §6 R6, runtime)

Landing: the commit that adds this section.

- `Except<L, K>` is `Except<L, K, MAX, MIN = 0>`: it counts the chain against its bounds, as `Bounded` does, so it
  holds the bare list. `Placed<L, K, MAX>`'s `MAX` is the chain's bound, the named entry included, where it was the
  bound of the others. Neither type had a user outside the runtime.
- The runtime adds `place_first` (a decoded chain placed at its first entry of the kind), `Without` and `SkipAt` (a
  list read without one entry, which a view holds), and `Except::slots`, so either arm is walked as `Slots`.
