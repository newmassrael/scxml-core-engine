 * @brief W3C SCXML 3.12.1: Internal Event Queue Management
 *
 * This class implements the W3C SCXML internal event queue semantics.
 * Internal events are placed at the back of the queue and processed
 * in FIFO order before external events (macrostep completion).
 *
 * Design Goals:
 * - Single source of truth for event queue logic
 * - Shared between static and interpreter engines
 * - Zero overhead when not used (inline methods)
 * - Template-based for type safety
 *
 * W3C SCXML References:
 * - Section 3.12.1: Internal Events
 * - Appendix D.1: Algorithm for SCXML Interpretation
