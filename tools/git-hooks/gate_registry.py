# The gate registry: what gates exist, what triggers each, what each needs
# built first, and what each costs.
#
# Gates are identified by a slug, never by position. The previous table
# keyed them by run order ("1", "1b", "2c", "8b"), which made the identifier
# and the schedule the same thing: reordering renamed gates, so the order
# could not be improved without breaking every reference to it, and each new
# gate had to be wedged in with a letter suffix instead of taking a place of
# its own. The evidence that this had stopped working was in the hook
# itself — three gates carried block comments naming a number two lower than
# their own label, left behind by an earlier renumbering, four gates
# mirroring one workflow were split across two number families, five gates
# were missing from the header list, and every label read "N/8" while
# seventeen gates existed.
#
# With slugs, order is derived rather than declared: `deps` says what must
# run first, `cost_s` says what is cheap, and the runner sorts by both. A
# gate added tomorrow lands in the right place without touching any other
# entry.
#
# Which gate a change needs is answered by the `paths:` filter on the CI
# workflow it mirrors, so those filters are read out of
# `.github/workflows/*.yml` rather than restated here — the hook cannot
# drift from CI the way a hand-copied table would, and a workflow that gains
# a path starts triggering its gate on the same commit that widens CI.
#
# Three rules keep the filtering from becoming a coverage hole, which is the
# failure mode a selective hook invites:
#
#   1. A changed path matching NO known glob — not a gate trigger and not
#      the inert list below — forces the FULL run. A new top-level directory
#      therefore gets more verification, never less.
#   2. Gates with no CI counterpart carry an explicit local trigger with the
#      reason written next to it, rather than being silently always-on or
#      silently never-on.
#   3. A gate whose trigger is the catch-all `**` is selected always and
#      counts as classifying nothing. Its workflow runs on every push, so a
#      match carries no information about whether a path is understood —
#      letting it count would mark every path in the repository known and
#      rule 1 would never fire again.

# ── Gate table ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# `workflows` names the CI workflow(s) a gate mirrors; its `paths:` filter
# is the trigger. `extra` adds locally-known triggers for what the
# workflow's filter cannot express, and `local` is for gates CI has no
# counterpart for. `deps` names gates whose output this one executes.
#
# `cost_s` is wall-clock seconds, MEASURED by `scripts/gate --measure --all`
# on a warm tree, not estimated. Warm is the right basis: a push happens on
# a tree the developer has just built, and a cold first build is paid once
# in whatever order the gates run. Two limits are worth stating rather than
# discovering later. The numbers come from a full run, so a gate that
# benefits from an earlier gate having warmed the cargo cache reads cheaper
# here than it would in isolation — which is the number that matters for
# ordering a full run, and the wrong one for judging a single gate. And the
# clock is whole seconds, so everything under a second reads 0.
#
# Re-measure after any gate's work changes materially; a stale cost is a
# wrong order, not a wrong comment. The value that motivated all of this
# was `ledger-citations`: the hook's prose called it "sub-second per
# workspace" and it sat last of seventeen, while a measurement puts the
# whole gate at 157s — still nowhere near last, and the prose was
# describing one step of it.

# ── Workflows with no gate ────────────────────────────────────────
#
# The other direction of the mirror. Every case in the self-test below asks
# whether a GATE has a workflow — it maps one that exists, it delegates or
# says why, it declares `no_ci_reason` when CI has no counterpart. Nothing
# asked whether a WORKFLOW has a gate, and a registry that only checks its
# own entries can only find the gaps it already knows about.
#
# What that blindness cost is measured. On 2026-08-11 seven of nineteen
# workflows had no local mirror and nothing recorded that they did not — the
# largest being `w3c-tests.yml`, whose seven jobs run the C++, Rust, Kotlin,
# Python, Go and C11 conformance suites. Its C++ suite had been failing 233
# of 234 cases for three weeks while every gate in this file passed, because
# no gate ran it and the lane itself could not turn red.
#
# An entry here is the same kind of claim `no_ci_reason` is, pointed the
# other way: a statement that this workflow's verdict is reproduced
# somewhere a developer reaches before pushing, or that it has no verdict to
# reproduce. A `commit-hook:<command>` reason is checked rather than
# believed — the named command must appear in the commit hook.
