// A formula per output: a static function of the caseless enum `TransformRounding` for each, a
// file of the module that calls them. A call is qualified by the enum
// (`TransformRounding.<function>(…)`), which a member of the calling type cannot hide as it would
// hide a free function of the same name. An output that reads another output calls its function.
