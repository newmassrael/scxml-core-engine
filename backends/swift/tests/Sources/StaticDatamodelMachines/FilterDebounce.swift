// A signal filter: a class whose `update` reads one sample and answers the filtered one, and
// whose `reset` forgets what it has seen. It holds its history, so each holder of one instance
// shares it. The runtime's filter is named by its module, so a document named for one of the
// runtime's classes (`moving_average`) cannot hide it.
