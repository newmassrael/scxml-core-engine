// A table interpolated between its breakpoints: a static function of the caseless enum
// `ForgeCallLimit`, a file of the module that calls it. A call is qualified by the enum
// (`ForgeCallLimit.lookup(…)`), which a member of the calling type cannot hide as
// it would hide a free function of the same name. An input outside an axis answers the value at
// the nearer end. The runtime is named by its module, so a document named for one of its types
// cannot hide it.
